# 👋 Hey, I’m Sherin Joseph Roy

### 🚀 Building meaningful tech that blends AI, safety, and real-world systems.

I’m a startup founder and systems thinker who loves turning complex ideas into simple, impactful tools.  
Currently working on projects around:

- 🧠 AI & intelligent agents  
- 🛡️ Safety tech & emergency systems  
- 🔌 IoT integrations with real-time intelligence  
- ⚙️ CLI tools and developer productivity
